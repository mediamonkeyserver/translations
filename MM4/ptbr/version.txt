2.4: Complete re-work in translation to MediaMonkey v2.4.x, based on existing 
     translation to v2.2, made by Paulino Michelazzo. Main changes include:
- Translation of new strings, included in v2.4.
- Correction of some typos in existing translation.
- Refinements in translation of all existing strings.
- Translation of "HelpContext.pas" file.
- Inclusion of "BrazilianPortuguese-4.1.8.isl" file with pt-br translation to InnoSetup's "Default.isl". It's basically the file available in InnoSetup's website, but it contains a lot of improvements and corrections. Don't fear in using it in future MediaMonkey's instalation.


ToDo:
